Wow, you actually decided to read this!

This game is obviously a real but dumbed down of the Prime Simulator series on BronyCFW's YouTube channel! 

The places you can shop are:

- Asda
- Wakefield Wines
- Aldi
- AliExpress
- eBay
- Amazon

They must be entered in the way shown above

If you want to contribute, or make mods and stuff like that, the code is all available on GitHub at https://github.com/wavetecrr/primesim !

Of course, this is a Python game, so you need Python installed. Visual Studio also works.
